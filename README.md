# Grade_Guru

## Overview

Grade Guru is a grade tracking mobile app. It is a project I had to do as part of a collaborative design class in early 2021. The app was previously hosted by my classmate on Heroku, when their hosting services were free. The code, as well as a case study of the project I performed for another class, are both still available.
